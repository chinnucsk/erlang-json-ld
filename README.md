# Erlang JSON-LD processor

This processor is heavily inspired from the python version written by [Bradley Allen](https://github.com/bradleypallen/json_ld_processor).

The goal is to be able to convert JSON-LD documents to N-triples.

## Credits
Thanks for Bradley Allen.

## Specification
You can find the current JSON-LD draft [here](http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/).

# TODO
 * Still lots to do so far (the project is in its infancy).
 * Still need to integrate lots of unit tests.
 * Obviously add more comments and docs.
